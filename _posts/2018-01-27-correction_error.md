This post should be the first about binary operations or more in general on low level discussions. It could be just a lot heavy but it's the hard way.

The errors correction and detection has a unique milestone: a system that would be able to detect and correct
an error that has occurred in the encoding during a transmission must use more bits in the source code or alphabet.
In this way the enconding will have bit configurations that will be not used and an error will transform the
transmitted valid bit configuration in a not valid one.

### Fondamental definition

**Hamming distance** from two possibile binary configurations is the number of different bit between the two one
